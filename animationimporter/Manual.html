<h3>Animator Video Reference</h3>
This plugin allows you to import a vide and use it for reference with animating. You can scrub through the video as well move through the video frame by frame. There is an option on the bottom as well to be able to export a set of frames to Krita to use for rotoscoping/tracing.

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>The tool exists in the Tools > Scripts menu under Animator Video Reference. The option at the top allows you to select your video file. Once it is loaded you will see a video preview of the first frame in the thumbnail area. The controls on the right allow you to step frame by frame for reference.</p>

<p>You can also export out a set of frames by setting the starting time, duration, frames per second, and step interval. The step interval has to do with skipping frames when importing. A value of 1 will keep all frames which is the default. If you want to import every other frame into Krita, you can specify 2. Press the Export button when you are ready and Krita will create a new document and import in the animation frames.</p>
